// Problem Description – Async Initialization Gate
//
// You are required to design a mechanism for APIs that depend on an
// asynchronous initialization step.
// Any calls made before initialization completes should be queued and
// executed only after the initialization finishes.
// Calls made after initialization should execute immediately.
//
// The initialization task and API functions must invoke callbacks when
// they complete.
class GuardedAPI {
  constructor() {}

  init(initTask) {}

  call(apiFn, onComplete) {}

  _flush() {}
}

module.exports = GuardedAPI;
