// Problem Description – Request Batcher
//
// You are required to implement a batcher that groups multiple requests
// within a short time window into a single bulk request.
//
// Requirements:
// 1. Requests added within the batch window must be sent together
// 2. Each caller must receive only its own result
// 3. Only one network call should be made per batch window

function createBatcher(fetchBulk, delayMs = 50) {
  return function add(id) {};
}
module.exports = createBatcher;
