// Problem Description – once(fn)

// You are required to implement a wrapper function named once that accepts an asynchronous function fn.
// The wrapper should ensure that fn is executed only on the first call.
// Any subsequent calls must not re-execute fn and should instead return the same Promise or resolved result from the first invocation.
function once(fn) {
 let called = false;
 let result;

 return function(...args){
    if(!called){
        called = true;
        result = fn(...args);
    }

    return result;
 };
}

module.exports = once;
