// Problem Description – sleep(ms)

// You are required to write a function named sleep that accepts a time duration in milliseconds. 
// The function should return a Promise that pauses execution for the given amount of time and then resolves.
function sleep(millis) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(resolve, millis);
    });
}
