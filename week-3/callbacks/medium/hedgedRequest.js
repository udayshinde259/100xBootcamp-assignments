// Problem Description – Hedged Request
//
// You have a Primary async source and a Secondary backup.
// Start the Primary immediately. If it is slow, start the Secondary.
//
// Return the first successful result and ignore the rest.
// Only fail if both fail, and ensure the callback runs once.
//
// Requirements:
// - Start Primary immediately.
// - Start Secondary after timeoutMs if needed.
// - First success wins.
// - Callback must be called exactly once.
function hedgedRequest(primary, secondary, timeoutMs, onComplete) {}
