// Problem Description – Ordered Parallel Batcher
//
// You need to process many items in parallel, but with a fixed
// concurrency limit to avoid resource exhaustion.
//
// Tasks should start as soon as a slot is free, and the final
// results must preserve the original input order.
//
// Requirements:
// - Run at most `limit` workers in parallel.
// - Preserve the original order of results.
// - Start new work as soon as one finishes.
// - Stop and return an error if any task fails.

function batchProcess(items, limit, worker, onComplete) {}

module.exports = batchProcess;
