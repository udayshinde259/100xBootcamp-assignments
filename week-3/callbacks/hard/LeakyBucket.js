// Problem Description – Leaky Bucket Rate Limiter
//
// You are required to implement a RateLimiter based on the Leaky Bucket algorithm.
//
// The rate limiter has a fixed capacity and processes tasks at a constant rate.
// Tasks are executed in the exact order they are received.
//
// Requirements:
// 1. The bucket has a maximum capacity
// 2. Tasks are processed at a fixed interval (leak rate)
// 3. If the bucket is full, new tasks must be rejected immediately
// 4. Fairness must be preserved (FIFO execution)

class LeakyBucket {
  constructor(capacity, leakRateMs) {}

  add(task) {}

  async _leak() {}
}


module.exports = LeakyBucket;
